  Hi! Iâ€™m Vatsal, a software engineer and an aspiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boffin">boffin</a>, primarily working with Java and Kotlin. I am also fascinated by functional programming languages particularly Haskell, OCaml and Lean.
</p>

<p>
  I like to think about pure mathematics, programming language design and compilers (among other things). Every now and then, I <a href="https://renaissancenerdblog.wordpress.com/">blog</a> about those things. It helps me think and learn more clearly.
</p>

<p>My CV is available upon request.</p>
